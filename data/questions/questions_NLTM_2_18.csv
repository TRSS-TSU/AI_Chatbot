question,answer
What is the authentication protocol used on Windows Challenge/Response systems?,NTLM
What are some of the disadvantages of using NTLM authentication?,"single authentication, security vulnerabilities, and outdated cryptography"
Why is NTLM systems vulnerable?,simplistic form of password hashing 
What is a single authentication method?,NTLM
What does NTLM use to establish the user?,challenge-response protocol
What is the process of using two or more pieces of information to confirm the identity of the user?,multifactor authentication
What does NTLM not support?,multifactor authentication 
What kind of attacks is NTLM systems vulnerable to ?,pass-the-hash and brute-force attacks
What does NTLM not do to make passwords more secure?,does not leverage the latest advances in algorithmic thinking or encryption to make passwords more secure
What is the authentication protocol used on networks that include systems running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems?,Windows Challenge/Response
What adds greater security than NTLM to systems on a network?,The Microsoft Kerberos security package
where information related to the user's password is kept,domain controller
What does NTLM need to be used on stand-alone systems?,logon authentication
What do NTLM credentials consist of?,"domain name, a user name, and a one-way hash of the user's password"
What does NTLM use to authenticate a user without sending the user's password over the wire?,an encrypted challenge/response protocol
The NTLM system requesting authentication must perform,a calculation that proves it has access to the secured NTLM credentials
Interactive NTLM authentication over a network typically involves two systems,a client system and domain controller
What three systems do noninteractive authentication involve?,"a client, a server, and a domain controller"
during interactive authentication what does the user provide,"a domain name, user name, and password"
What does the client compute?,a cryptographic hash of the password
In what format does the client send the user name to the server?,plaintext
What is the 8-byte random number that the server generates called?,a challenge or nonce
The client encrypts the challenge with what?,the hash of the user's password
"the server sends the user name, challenge, and the response to what?",domain controller
What does the domain controller use to retrieve the hash of the user's password from the Security Account Manager database?,the user name
What does the domain controller compare the encrypted challenge computed to the response computed by the client?,"If they are identical, authentication is successful"
the application should not access to what,NTLM security package 
What does Negotiate use to enable your application to take advantage of more advanced security protocols if they are supported by the systems involved in the authentication?,Negotiate security package
What does Negotiate allow your application to take advantage of if they are supported by the systems involved in the authentication?,more advanced security protocols
The Negotiate security package selects between Kerberos and what?,NTLM
Negotiate selects Kerberos unless ,it cannot be used by one of the systems involved in the authentication
What is outdated in NTLM authentication?,cryptography
Pass-the-hash and brute force are two modes of what?,attacks
What is the NTLM authentication protocol used on?,networks that include systems running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems
What is kept in the domain controller?,information related to the user's password
What is the name of the system that does the authentication calculations on behalf of the server?,domain controller
What is the system where the user is requesting authentication?,client system
Negotiate selects which unless it cannot be used by one of the systems involved in the authentication?,Kerberos
What is the security package that your application should not access directly?,NTLM
"If the systems involved in the negotiation are identical, what is successful?",authentication
What is the best way to take advantage of advanced security protocols?,Negotiate
What is the advantage of using Negotiate?,allows your application to take advantage of more advanced security protocols
What does the domain controller compare the encrypted challenge it computed to?,the response computed by the client
What is required for a security protocol to be supported by Negotiate?,the systems involved in the authentication
